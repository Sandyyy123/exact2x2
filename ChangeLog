1.2-0.0
- fix McNemar's test (exact2x2 paired=TRUE) so that if both off diagonal values are 0, then gives p-value of 1 instead of error.
- moved vignettes to vignette directory


1.1-1.0
- fix problem for exact2x2 function when input uses `x,y'-style input and both x and y are factors with 2 levels, 
  but one of x or y has only one level observed.(Thanks to Hamilton Gross for finding this error).


1.1-0.0
- fix problem with the exact2x2CI function. Now calculates this in a much faster and more accurate way. Previously, 
  it gave incorrect intervals for the tsmethod="minlike" in some cases with large counts. See comments in 
  interval function within exact2x2CI function of R code. (Thanks to Nan Bing for finding this error).

1.0-1.1
- update CITATION file

1.0-1
- update reference to Fay (2009) to reflect print version, Fay (2010)
- add plot option to exact2x2 function to plot p-value function
- change exact2x2Plot and internal function so that method is now tsmethod

1.0-0
- add exact McNemar's test (paired=TRUE), for that the package now depends on the exactci package
- add envir=parent.frame to do.call in fisher.exact, without it gave error if name of first input is "y"
- do same as above for blaker.exact
- update reference to Fay (2009), add citation file



0.9-3

- fix problem with exact2x2CI, gave wrong confidence interval for some 2x2 tables
- fix conf.int=FALSE to work correctly for 'blaker' and 'minlike' methods, still ignored for 'central'
- fix p-value for blaker test to be always less than or equal to 1
- fix blaker.exact and fisher.exact to work correctly when y!=NULL
- minor editing of some man pages
- minor editing of some code for clarity

0.9-1 First release
